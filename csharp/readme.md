In this folder please find two C# samples.

#Media App Sample
This sample is an end-to-end full Media App that demonstrates how to customize an application from Xbox to phone using Adaptive Triggers and panels.  The master branch incorporates the new MediaPlayerElement that became available with Windows Anniversary Edition (SDK version 14393.)  The MediaAppSample_MediaElement branch will not be updated but it does implement content playback using a MediaElement control.  

#WebViewTVjs
This sample demonstrates how to use tv.js within a XAML WebView control.  It also demonstrates how to manage navigation within a WevView control that loads web content as well as how to handle page navigation.
